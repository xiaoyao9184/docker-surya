# Why

I found that Surya's Docker image is difficult to find.
The code on [GitHub](https://github.com/VikParuchuri/surya) does not provide a pre-built Docker image.

After reviewing the following items

- [linux.do](https://linux.do/t/topic/239082)

This project will use GitHub Actions and Docker Hub to build and publish images,
aiming to keep the process as clean as possible without custom configuration files.

# Tags

The images of this project will be published to Docker Hub under the repository [xiaoyao9184/surya](https://hub.docker.com/r/xiaoyao9184/surya).

Since this project references the Surya project via a submodule, it cannot monitor push events on the Surya project, and therefore cannot automatically create an image for every commit.
A good solution is to manually trigger the action and tag it with the commit id. For more details, see this article [set-dynamic-parameters-github-workflows-en](https://damienaicheh.github.io/github/actions/2022/01/20/set-dynamic-parameters-github-workflows-en.html).

The default image name format is `${DOCKERHUB_USERNAME}/surya`.

The tag uses the input parameter `commit_id`,
which can be either a branch name or a commit id,
when manually triggering the [docker-image-tag-commit](./.github/workflows/docker-image-tag-commit.yml) job.
if the job is triggered by a submodule update push,
the default branch name `master` will be used instead of the `commit_id` parameter.
This job will also use the shortened commit id as the tag.

If the job [docker-image-tag-version](./.github/workflows/docker-image-tag-version.yml) is triggered with the `surya_version` parameter set to the PyPI Surya version number,
the Surya package published on PyPI will be installed for the build,
and `surya_version` will be used as the tag.

Currently, only the `linux/amd64` platform is supported.

# Model

The models of this project will be synced to HuggingFace under the collection [xiaoyao9184/surya-and-marker](https://huggingface.co/collections/xiaoyao9184/surya-and-marker-68635abc74f33ef5d5be792d).

The Docker image does not include model files.
When running, the required models will be automatically downloaded.

If you need to run offline, you must pre-download the model files and enable offline mode.
See [cache/README.md](./cache/README.md) for detailed instructions.

# Service

By default, the Docker container runs the Streamlit App, which comes from the original project.

However, this project also provides a Gradio App, a functional reimplementation of the Streamlit version.
The Gradio App supports both a UI and API interface, and can even serve as an MCP server,
so it is recommended as the preferred option.

The source code for the Gradio App is located in the [gradio](./gradio) directory of this project.
A demo of this project is also available and auto-synced on Hugging Face Spaces: [xiaoyao9184/surya](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xiaoyao9184/surya)

To run the Gradio App, you can do so by modifying the Docker command. see the `up.gradio` sub-directory in the [docker](./docker) directory for details.

And this project also provides Label Studio ML Backend.

The source code for the Label Studio ML Backend is located in the [label](./label) directory of this project.

To run the Label Studio ML Backend, you can do so by modifying the Docker command. see the `up.label` sub-directory in the [docker](./docker) directory for details.

# Change

You can fork this project and build your own image. You will need to provide the following variables: `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`, `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, `HF_USERNAME`, `HF_TOKEN`.
See [this](https://github.com/docker/login-action#docker-hub) for more details.
